# Graduate-RSA-Housing-Demographics-Practicum-Project June-August 2018
The Rutgers Student Affairs Housing Demographics project was a final practicum project where Rutgers Student Affairs was trying to understand how students selected their school dorms based on socio-demographic patterns. The project consisted of analyzing 8 years of previously unexplored student data where a significant time was spent cleaning and manipulating the data for analysis. The data was cleaned and manipulated in Python and Excel while, regression analysis, decision trees, K-modes clustering, and random forest were performed in R. Visualizations were done in Tableau. The following repository consists of the data cleaning portion given that its findings cannot be made public without Rutgers University authorization.

JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS:
1st Code Performs Data cleaning.
2nd Code Creates GPA proxies for SAT/ACT.
3rd Code Merges GPA to every student during their time at Housing. 
# Analytical Task Assigned
Perform Data Analysis on Rutgers Resident Student Life data (2010-2018) and search for patterns of self-segregation.

Data Analytics Summer 2018 Practicum Residence Life Trends Analysis This is a communication site between Student Affairs Research and Assessment and graduate students in MBS (Data Analytics). The purpose of this assessment is to conduct a longitudinal trends examination of student demographic characteristics in the residence halls at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and determine whether there are patterns of self-segregation. Specifically, the assessment seeks to answer the following questions:

(a) What are the characteristics to describe students living in particular residence halls? How do these characteristics vary by building and campus?

(b) How have the characteristics of students living in specific buildings and locations changed over time?

(c) What characteristics are most salient with respect to time, building and location?

(d) To what extent does race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, or academic affiliation predict studentsâ€™ residence location and building type? How have these patterns changed over time?

The dataset spans eight academic years. Each datafile (year) ranges from 13,000 to close to 16,000 cases. Residence Life provided information on room category, campus, building, room number, room type, gender, admit term, and class year. The following student characteristics will be merged into the datafile: residence hall costs, academic affiliation (e.g., school), race/ethnicity, and financial aid marker (e.g., pell grant).
